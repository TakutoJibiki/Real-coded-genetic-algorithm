# Minimizing Rastrigin function
In `test_rastrigin.py`, the objective function to be minimized, called Rastrigin function, is defined as follows:

$$
f(x_{1}, x_{2})=20+\sum_{i=1}^{2}(x_{i}^2-10\cos(2\pi x_{i}))
$$

This function takes the minimum value $0$ at $(x_{1}, x_{2})=(0, 0)$. Optimization results are shown in the images below. They indicate that the global optimal solution has been obtained.
